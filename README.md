# Supply-Chain-Management-in-Automotive-Industry

The supply chain process of an automotive industry is highly complex and requires high number of labor and analysis to carry forward the smooth management. To keep up with the demands of the ever increasing customers and the technological advancements, our project aims at automating some important processes in the supply chain and incorporate the latest technology to make the company ready for future trends and changes. Below the Supply chain processes is summarised where apart from the basic structure that includes supplier, plant, warehouse, logistics and retailer addition of processes such as demand forecasting, material requirement planning, order management would help boost up the entire system. It would provide the company to be prepared of the future advances, cut down on cost and much more. Our solution aims to help the companies achieve this.

The solution consists of parts to tackle different problems and also advance the system to make it ready for the changing market. Our main focuses lies in three domains in the supply chain process such as:

Demand Forecasting 
Demand Forecasting is the process in which historical sales data is used to develop an estimate of an expected forecast of customer demand. To businesses, Demand Forecasting provides an estimate of the amount of goods and services that its customers will purchase in the foreseeable future. 	
Sourcing and Outsourcing 
Sourcing and Outsourcing includes the supplies transport from the warehouse to the plant and also transporting of the finished products. Predictive analysis is used to find the optimal distance that has be travelled and received items from. 
Invoice Data Analysis 
Data obtained from the invoices by sourcing and outsourcing can provide important insights about the finances of the company which in turn can help companies make important decisions, it helps in finding the best possible modes of shipment for faster and convenient delivery.

## Part A- Demand Forecasting
AI-lead supply chain optimization software amplifies important decisions by using cognitive predictions and recommendations on optimal actions. This can help enhance overall supply chain performance. It also helps manufacturers with possible implications across various scenarios in terms of time, cost, and revenue. Also, by constantly learning over time, it continuously improves on these recommendations as relative conditions change.

## Part B - Sourcing and Outsourcing
In fields like logistics, transportation, air travel, and more, these calculations deliver a key component for examining the fastest, shortest, and most efficient routes between two locations. For logistics, where distance and time can be the difference between profits and losses, finding the shortest possible point between two locations can greatly improve travel times and reduce wasted resources. More importantly, it can help calculations that feature several moving parts.
When Brakes item is considered--

time to deliver from Pune is 26 HOURS
time to deliver from Delhi is 4 HOURS

### Trip Duration Prediction

The purpose of this modelling is to accurately predict the trip duration of taxi. To make predictions we will use several algorithms, tune the corresponding parameters of the algorithm by analysis each parameter against RMSE and predict the trip duration.

## Part C - Invoice Data Analysis 

The real complexities of the automotive supply chain, and yet it should at least suggest the high  degree of complexity that would be involved in true supply chain optimization. Given the  number of moving parts, it would be ridiculous to expect a single supply chain planner with an  Excel spreadsheet to create a supply stream that was even remotely optimized.
Designed to help automotive companies with the management  of their critical documents from creation to approval, publishing to archiving, and deleting it  permanently from the system. Solution comes with the extended capability to schedule approval,  archival, and managing documents well in advance. An organization can collaborate with users  for review of the document. Moreover, the users get notifications about the same.

## Dashboard

Dashboard mainly focuses on the questions emerging by the supply chain management system which needs to implement production according to the current trends.
 
What’s our Sales Revenue? Where is our Sales Revenue compared to where it should be?
How many signups has the management system done this week? Was it more or less than last week?
What is the share of sales per month? Has there been an increase in Revenue per month?
What does our profit margin look like? Is it on target?
By taking raw data from a number of sources and consolidating it before presenting it in a tailored, customized dashboard, data dashboards can help make sense of your company’s most valuable data and empower you to find actionable answers to your most burning business questions.
In doing so, your business will be data-driven, and as a direct result – more successful.
